**Time:** 10 minutes  
**Artifact:**   

## What I did
- Configured hostnames on the router and switches
- Configured IP addresses on R1 interface and endpoints
- Manually configured speed and duplex settings on interfaces connected to other network devices
- Configured descriptions on each interface
- Disabled unused interfaces
- Saved configurations to startup-config
- Configured IP addresses for endpoints using Packet Tracer GUI
- Pinged PC4 from PC1 to test connectivity. Success.

## Notes
- Easy. Much needed CLI practice. Really helped.
