# Lab 06 — [Configuring IP Addresses]

**Time:**   15 minutes
**Artifact:** 

## What I did
- Changed router hostname from 'Router' to 'R1'
- Used 'show ip interface brief' to view R1's interfaces and their statuses
- Configured R1 interface IPs to the listed values using CLI, saved to startup-config
- Configured PC IP addresses using the Packet Tracer GUI
- Pinged PC3 and PC2 from PC1 to test router configuration. Success.


## Proof (minimum)
- Routers configured: ![Routers connected screenshot](./screenshots/routers-connected.png) 

- Pinging outside the LAN: ![Pingtest screenshot](./screenshots/ping.png)

## Notes
- Packet Tracer took a while to simulate the ping traffic so I thought I was having an issue. Double checked the router interfaces and PC IP addresses and while doing that the pings succeeded. I'll just click through the steps next time.
